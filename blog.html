      <p>Even though Malia Kawaguchi only learned how to ride a bicycle a few years ago, today you can see her on two wheels all around Redmond!</p>
      <p>Malia and her family moved next to the Sammamish River Trail and they found that most everything they needed in Redmond could be reached by bike. With easy access to trails and bike lanes Malia is now biking to pick up groceries at Trader Joes, riding over to the Redmond Saturday Market with her daughter, and taking her bike panniers to buy essentials at Target. “Being on a bike is like being in a convertible, but I’m getting exercise!” she told us recently.</p>

      <p>Even replacing short trips car trips with those done on bike will have a positive impact on the environment. Four miles roundtrip on a bike-which is about the distance between Redmond City Hall and Blazing Bagels-will keep about 15 pounds of pollutants out of the air we breathe! That’s nothing to sneeze at.</p>
      <p>About 40% of all trips are within two miles of home, yet more than 80% of  these trips are made by car. A two mile bike ride is usually less than 15 minutes, and a great way to sneak more exercise into your day.</p>
      <p>Think what an impact we could have in Redmond if we replaced some of these short trips like Malia has done in our human-powered convertibles (aka, bicycles). We’d certainly be having more fun than sitting in traffic.</p>
