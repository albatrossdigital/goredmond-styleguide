            <p>Even replacing short trips car trips with those done on bike will have a positive impact on the environment. Four miles roundtrip on a bike-which is about the distance between Redmond City Hall and Blazing Bagels-will keep about 15 pounds of pollutants out of the air we breathe! That’s nothing to sneeze at.</p>
            <p>About 40% of all trips are within two miles of home, yet more than 80% of  these trips are made by car. A two mile bike ride is usually less than 15 minutes, and a great way to sneak more exercise into your day.</p>
            <p>Think what an impact we could have in Redmond if we replaced some of these short trips like Malia has done in our human-powered convertibles (aka, bicycles). We’d certainly be having more fun than sitting in traffic.</p>

          <h1>Regulations</h1>
          <h5>We are here to help navigate through state and city transportation laws</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="row two-columns">
          <div class="col-md-6 gutter">
            <h2>Commute Trip Reduction Laws</h2>
            <p>The Washington State Legislature passed the <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.94.531" target="_self">Commute Trip Reduction</a> (CTR) Law in 1991. Some Redmond employers are affected by the following regulations. The City of Redmond adopted the law into the municipal code, which is located in Chapter 5.65 under <a href="https://www.gortrip.com/Files/Download/23a6c630-a8be-4935-9e30-571e175707b2/" target="_Blank">Business Licenses and Regulations</a>.</p>

            <h3>Is My Business Affected?</h3>

            <p>Employers are affected by the CTR Law if you have 100 or more full-time employees at a single worksite who begin their workday between 6:00 am and 9:00 am at least two days a week.</p>

            <h3>Can my company participate if we are not affected by the CTR Law?</h3>

            <p>Yes! The City of Redmond encourages all Redmond employers to participate in a commute reduction program, regardless if you are required by law. Companies not affected by the law have all the same access to tools and services available to promote commute alteratives.</p>

            <h3>I am newly affected by CTR law. Now what do I do?</h3>

            <p>The CTR law requires employers that meet the definition of an affected employerto identify themselves to the local city/county within 180 days of either moving into the boundaries of the jurisdiction or growing in employment to 100 or more employees.</p>

            <h3>Minimal Requirements</h3>

            <p>CTR-affected employers are required to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Assign an Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC) to manage the commute program</li>
              <li>Survey employees every two years to assess progress toward CTR goals.</li>
              <li>Submit an annual employer program report - Due each November 1st</li>
              <li>Act in good faith to reduce drive-alone commute trips</li>
            </ul>

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 gutter">

            <h2>Transportation Management Program</h2>

            <p>A Transportation Management Program (TMP) is a condition of new commercial development <a href="http://www.zoningplus.com/regs/redmond/index.aspx?Nav=browse&amp;index=4089&amp;keywords=Transportation+Management+Program" target="_blank">(Redmond Zoning Code 21.52.020)</a>. Each TMP contains a performance goal, survey and reporting requirements, along with a set of elements to assist in achieving and maintaining the development's performance level. These elements include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A Transportation Coordinator</li>
              <li>Marketing and Promotion of the program</li>
              <li>Preferential parking for carpools and vanpools</li>
              <li>Transportation Information Centers</li>
              <li>Membership in a Transportation Management Association</li>
              <li>Incentives (at least one incentive equivalent to a two-zone peak period transit pass)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At least one additional financial incentive or equivalent program identified as a contingency measure in the event that target goals are not met.</p>

            <p>Property owners may also propose a demonstrated, equally effective alternative in lieu of a required element. Such substitution is subject to approval by the City's Technical Committee.</p>

            <p>R-TRIP can assist property owners, employers, and tenants in meeting TMP performance goals by providing program administration capabilities through the Commute Management System, starter incentives and subsidies, and marketing and other resource assistance.</p>

            <h3>Mix and Match</h3>
            <p>If you have a long commute, buses and many vanpools have bike racks so you can easily mix and match biking with a second alternative commute type. Bikes make a quick and easy "last mile" connection to get you between the bus stop and work, or from home to the bus stop.</p>
            <h3>Save Time and Be Active</h3>
            <p>Biking is an excellent way to combine your daily exercise routine with your commute. It burns calories, reduces stress, and improves overall health.</p>

                  <h1>Town of Springfield</h1>
                  <p><i>Springfield is the fictional town in which the American animated sitcom The Simpsons is set. A mid-sized town in an undetermined state of the United States, Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society.</i></p>
                  <h2>Businesses</h2>
                  <h3>Springfield Nuclear Power Plant</h3>
                  <p>The Springfield Nuclear Power Plant is a nuclear power plant in Springfield owned by Montgomery Burns. The plant has the monopoly on the city of Springfield's energy supply, and the carelessness of Mr. Burns and the plant's employees (like Homer, who is employed at Sector 7G) often endangers the residents and natural environment of Springfield. At the core of the plant are two Fissionator 1952 Slow-Fission Reactors, operating in spite of more than 342 safety violations with an estimated repair bill to bring the plant up to code being in excess of $56 million. The plant has come close to a meltdown several times, and blown up at least once.</p>
                  <h4>Employees</h4>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Owner: Charles Montgomery Burns</li>
                  <li>Owner's executive assistant: Waylon Smithers</li>

                  Employees: Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson and others</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Barney's Bowl-A-Rama</h3>
                  <p>Barney's Bowl-A-Rama is the bowling alley in Springfield. It is owned by Barney Gumble's Uncle Al. The Bowl-A-Rama has appeared several times in Simpsons episodes. The very first known appearance is the episode "Life on the Fast Lane" where Homer forgets Marge's birthday and after rushing out to purchase a gift, he ends up buying a bowling ball. Marge is insulted at the fact her gift from Homer was something obviously intended for his own personal use given the fact the ball had Homer's name engraved on it. Marge decides she will keep the gift for her own use and goes bowling for the first time. This is seen destroyed in The Simpsons Movie.</p>
                  <h3>Moe's Tavern</h3>
                  <p>Moe's Tavern is a local bar in Springfield frequented by Homer Simpson, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard and Barney Gumble. The tavern is named after and run by Moe Szyslak. Moe's Tavern first appeared in the episode "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". In the first season of The Simpsons, the entrance appeared to be a saloon door. The bar sells mostly Duff Beer although other beverages are served. In the episode "Flaming Moe's", Moe's beer payments were delinquent so his beer distributor stopped delivering to him. When Homer shows Moe a drink he developed called the Flaming Homer, Moe sells it as his own, calling it the Flaming Moe. The drink becomes extremely popular until Homer reveals its secret ingredient, allowing other businesses to create a similar product. The drink's popularity wanes significantly.</p>
