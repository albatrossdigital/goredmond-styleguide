        <h3>Mix and Match</h3>

        <p>If you have a long commute, buses and many vanpools have bike racks so you can easily mix and match biking with a second alternative commute type. Bikes make a quick and easy "last mile" connection to get you between the bus stop and work, or from home to the bus stop.</p>

        <h3>Save Time and Be Active</h3>

        <p>Biking is an excellent way to combine your daily exercise routine with your commute. It burns calories, reduces stress, and improves overall health.</p>
