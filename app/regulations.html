        <h2 class="margin-top-none">Commute Trip Reduction Laws</h2>

        <p>The Washington State Legislature passed the&nbsp;<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.94.531" target="_self">Commute Trip&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction</a>&nbsp;(CTR) Law in 1991. Some Redmond employers are affected by the following regulations. The City of Redmond&nbsp;adopted the law into the municipal code, which is located in Chapter 5.65 under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gortrip.com/Files/Download/23a6c630-a8be-4935-9e30-571e175707b2/" target="_Blank">business licenses and regulations</a>&nbsp;[pdf].</p>

        <h3><strong>Is my business affected?</strong></h3>

        <p>Employers are affected by the CTR Law if you have 100 or more full-time employees at a single worksite who begin their workday between 6:00 am and 9:00 am at least two days a week.</p>

        <h3><strong>Can my company participate if we are not affected by the CTR Law?</strong></h3>

        <p>Yes! The City of Redmond encourages all Redmond employers to participate in a commute reduction program, regardless if you are required by law. Companies not affected by the law have all the same access to tools and services available to promote commute alteratives.</p>

        <h3><strong>I am newly affected&nbsp;by CTR law. Now what do I do?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

        <p>The CTR law requires employers that meet the definition of an affected employerto identify themselves to the local city/county&nbsp;within 180 days of either moving into the boundaries of the jurisdiction or&nbsp;growing in employment to 100 or more employees.</p>

        <h2>Minimal Requirements</h2>

        <p>CTR-affected employers are required to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
          <div>Assign an&nbsp;Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC) to manage the commute program</div>
          </li>
          <li>
          <div>Survey employees every two years to assess progress toward CTR goals.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
          <div>Submit an annual employer program report - Due each November 1st</div>
          </li>
          <li>
          <div>Act in good faith to reduce drive-alone commute trips</div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="margin-top-none">Transportation Management Program (TMP)</h2>

        <p>A Transportation Management Program (TMP) is&nbsp;&nbsp;a condition of new commercial development.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zoningplus.com/regs/redmond/index.aspx?Nav=browse&amp;index=4089&amp;keywords=Transportation+Management+Program" target="_blank">(Redmond Zoning Code 21.52.020.)&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; Each TMP contains a performance goal, survey and reporting requirements, along with a set of elements to assist in achieving and&nbsp;maintaining the development's performance level. These elements include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
          <div>A&nbsp;Transportation Coordinator</div>
          </li>
          <li>
          <div>Marketing and Promotion of the program</div>
          </li>
          <li>
          <div>Preferential parking for carpools and&nbsp;vanpools</div>
          </li>
          <li>
          <div>Transportation Information Centers</div>
          </li>
          <li>
          <div>Membership in a Transportation Management Association</div>
          </li>
          <li>
          <div>Incentives (at least one incentive equivalent to a two-zone peak period transit pass)</div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>At&nbsp;least one additional financial incentive or equivalent program identified as a&nbsp;contingency measure in the event that target goals are not met.</p>

        <p>Property owners may also propose a&nbsp;demonstrated, equally effective alternative in lieu of a required element. Such substitution is subject to approval by the City's Technical Committee.</p>

        <p>R-TRIP can assist property owners, employers,&nbsp;and tenants in meeting TMP performance goals by providing program administration&nbsp;capabilities through the Commute Management System, starter incentives and subsidies, and marketing and other resource&nbsp;assistance.</p>
